A large collection of extensions to the Haskell standard library as well as
libraries from hackage.

Mostly consists of simple, commonly used wrappers in my personal projects.

There's quite a bit of variance in terms of code-quality: some of the older
modules (from when I was learning haskell) could use some polish with newly
acquired knowledge, and some of the newer modules could use better naming.
